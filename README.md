# sales-analysis
In this project, I use a sample of a company's monthly sales dataset for 1 year (January 2019 - December 2019) in a distinct (.csv) file and contain product name, price, quantity sold, order date, and purchase address.  <br>
I analyze and visualize the data based on basic business questions and analyze the behavior of the customer of the company.  <br>
I found that there is a rise in sales at particular hours and concluded that these particular hours were the best time to advertise the products. Then, I found that there are some particular products that are sold together. Also, there are several cities with low market penetration. <br>
